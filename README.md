# Agentic Ethereum Hackathon India

# 🛠 AgriChain - [Team Hackathians]

Welcome to our submission for the *Agentic Ethereum Hackathon* by Reskilll & Geodework! This repository includes our revolutionary agricultural marketplace that bridges farmers and consumers using AI-powered agents and blockchain technology.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

We addressed the challenge: *"Building AI Agents for Real-World Impact"*  

**The Challenge:** Traditional agricultural markets suffer from:
- 🌾 Information asymmetry between farmers and buyers
- 💰 Unfair pricing due to intermediary exploitation  
- 🌍 Limited market access for rural farmers
- 📱 Digital divide preventing technology adoption
- 🤝 Lack of transparent, secure transaction mechanisms

Rural farmers lose 20-40% of their potential income due to these systemic issues, while consumers pay inflated prices for fresh produce.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture

```solidity
// Main marketplace contract
contract FarmerMarket {
    struct Product {
        uint256 id;
        address farmer;
        string name;
        uint256 price;
        uint256 quantity;
        bool isAvailable;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Product) public products;
    mapping(address => bool) public verifiedFarmers;
    
    event ProductListed(uint256 indexed productId, address indexed farmer);
    event OrderPlaced(uint256 indexed orderId, address indexed buyer);
}
```

### AI Agent Implementation

```javascript
// Market Intelligence Agent
class MarketIntelligenceAgent {
    async getMarketPrices(crop, location) {
        const marketData = await this.fetchRealTimeData(crop, location);
        return this.analyzePrice({
            minPrice: marketData.min,
            maxPrice: marketData.max,
            avgPrice: marketData.average,
            trend: this.calculateTrend(marketData.historical)
        });
    }
    
    async generateNegotiationStrategy(product, buyer) {
        const strategy = await this.groqAPI.analyze({
            productPrice: product.price,
            marketRate: await this.getMarketPrices(product.name, buyer.location),
            farmerReputation: product.farmer.reputation
        });
        return strategy;
    }
}
```

### Feature Phone Interface

```javascript
// SMS Command Handler
app.post('/sms', (req, res) => {
    const { From, Body } = req.body;
    const command = Body.trim().toUpperCase();
    
    switch(command) {
        case 'LIST':
            return sendProductList(From);
        case 'PRICE RICE':
            return sendPrice('rice', From);
        case 'HELP':
            return sendHelp(From);
        default:
            return sendError(From);
    }
});
```
